In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of Pizza Hut's 2015 sales data. I began by cleaning and organizing the data using MySQL to ensure accuracy and consistency. 
After preparing the dataset, I conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover key insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and seasonal patterns.
To predict future sales, I applied time series forecasting techniques, enabling accurate sales projections for the remainder of 2015. 
This project demonstrates my proficiency in data cleaning, organization, and advanced forecasting methodologies to drive actionable business insights. 

In this project i had created a data model of Bus modelling where the cardianality is 1:many(*) in the data set. 
Basically it's a 2015 pizza store data where the sales had been given upto dec-2015 but i had used the time series function and forcast the sales of january 2016 upto 15 days,
Also i found the total revenue with the help of New Measure by pizza price*quantity from different tables.
